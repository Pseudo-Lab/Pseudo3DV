> Welcome to Pseudo3DV repository! We aim to study cutting-edge solutions for 3D vision challenges, offering tools and frameworks for 3D data processing, reconstruction, and analysis. Join us in advancing the field of 3D computer vision through open collaboration and innovation!


## 🚀 Activities

### 10th
- Coming soon…

### 9th
- [NeRF with RealWorld (by Wongi Park)](https://github.com/Pseudo-Lab/NeRFwithRealWorld)
    - 📄 [Merged_PPT (PDF)](./PDF/9th_NeRFWithRealWorld_PPT_Merge)


<h2>📜 Participation Rules 📜</h2>
Our Pseudo3DV operates under the principles of active participation and constructive communication. To maintain a productive and engaging study environment, we ask that all participants adhere to the following guidelines:

- **P**roactive Communication
- **S**oft Discussions*
- **E**ssential Prior Knowledge of NeRF & 3DGS
- **U**nderstanding with Code
- **D**iscussions with Constructive 
- **O**bligate Camera Usage (CAM)

Together, we build a collaborative and enriching learning experience! 🚀
